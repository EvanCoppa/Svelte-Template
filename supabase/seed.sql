-- Applied by `npm run db:reset`, after every migration in supabase/migrations.
-- It never runs against a hosted project, so the credentials below are fixed
-- and public on purpose: they exist so `npm run dev` and the Playwright suite
-- have a user to sign in as without anyone having to provision one by hand.
--
--   dev@example.com / password123    ← sign in with this while developing
--   e2e@example.com / password123    ← reserved for the E2E suite

-- NEVER put a real credential in this file. It is committed.

-- Creating an auth user in SQL means writing the two rows GoTrue expects:
-- `auth.users` (the account) and `auth.identities` (the email login method).
-- A user with no identity row exists but cannot sign in with a password.
-- Columns like `confirmed_at` are GENERATED — assigning them is an error.
